# YARM (Yet Another Rom Manager)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Drakmyth/yarm)](https://github.com/Drakmyth/yarm/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

YARM is a mod manager in the same vein as [Romcenter](https://www.romcenter.com/), [RomVault](https://romvault.com/), [Romulus](https://romulus.cc/), [Clrmamepro](https://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/), and others. This application is built using the Electron framework to facilitate cross-platform availability.

Existing mod managers are often criticised as either being unintuitive to use, having poor performance, or both. There is also a surprising lack of open source mod managers. Two birds, one stone...

## Issues
If you come across something that seems like a bug, please report it here. Make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure your report isn't closed as "Invalid":

* Make sure you are using the latest Release version of YARM. Old versions of the application are unsupported. Features and fixes will not be backported to old versions.
* Search to see if someone else has already reported the bug. Duplicate reports just slow down getting things fixed.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue in your report. Screenshots or videos may also prove helpful.
